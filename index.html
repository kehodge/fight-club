       <h2>About Fight Club</h2>
        <div>
       <p>Directed by oscar nominee David Fincher, this “darkest of dark 
       satires” starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Norton gives a outstanding performance
       as a label-obsessed insomniac on the verge of going postal. Befriending a interesting 
       soap salesman, they embarks on an existential crusade that takes them both to
       the brutal,raw heights of their insanity.</p> 
       
       <p>Starting a small fight club became a movement within itself and triggers man across
       the world to embrace their inner beast, anger and disappointment in todays society
       and take their life back.Stop being defined by your credit score, case number or
       your wealth be defined as the man you are.</p>
